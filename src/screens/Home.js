                Alpaviraam-Our Story
                Having found the similar interest and understanding of the practices in psychotherapy, we decided on creating a
                space together which resonated with our ideas of practice. Thus, taking a ‘pause’ from our individual work
                helped us create “Alpaviraam”.Alpaviraam (Comma&-punctuation in English) literally means a pause between parts of a sentence, or a small
                interval. There is always an Alpaviraam, when the sentences clutter and stop making sense as well as when there
                is something more to look forward to. When used properly, these commas help making meaning out of the
                sentences much like how we intend to use this space for mental health.
